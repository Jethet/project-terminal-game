# project-terminal-game

This is a project to build two versions of the tic tac toe game.

Ome approach is to create the tic-tac-toe game with JavaScript and Node.js to be played in console. The Node.js learning is focused on getting console input and manipulating this in a game, fully interactive in the console.

The second approach is to build a React version of the game.
